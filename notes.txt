TODO:
- [X] Remove balance because we can not keep track of it
      Balance is more like a virtual thing
      This should be called withdrawn
- [ ] nft.withdrawn should be balanceOf() -> No I think this is wrong
- [X] when protocol launch we have an xp deadlock
- [X] we need to access the id => nft mapping by tokenByIndex
- [X] add README.md
- [X] rename recipient to receiver
- [X] automatic etherscan verification (should work out of the box)


GAS SAVINGS:
- [ ] unchecked in loop
- [ ] unnessary assignments like dNFT.sol line 122

UNCERTAINTIES:
- [ ] can it happen that every nft deposit is negative?
      this would make `multiProductsSum` in sync() equal to 0
