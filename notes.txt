TODO:
- [X] Remove balance because we can not keep track of it
      Balance is more like a virtual thing
      This should be called withdrawn
- [ ] nft.withdrawn should be balanceOf() -> No I think this is wrong
- [X] when protocol launch we have an xp deadlock
- [ ] we need to access the id => nft mapping by tokenByIndex


GAS SAVINGS:
- [ ] unchecked in loop
